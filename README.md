## Project Overview
This study investigates **how cultural representation in video games influences player anxiety and engagement**. The research examines whether culturally relevant gaming content affects players differently based on their cultural background.

### Key Objectives:
âœ… Understand if **culturally aligned video games reduce player anxiety** compared to non-cultural games.  
âœ… Analyze **engagement levels** in culturally relevant vs. non-relevant games.  
âœ… Identify **statistically significant predictors** of player anxiety and engagement using **ANOVA, regression, and power analysis**.  
âœ… Provide **data-driven insights** to inform culturally inclusive game design.

## Research Questions & Hypotheses

### Primary Research Question:
- Do video games with **cultural representation** influence **player anxiety and engagement**, particularly when the playerâ€™s cultural background matches the gameâ€™s content?

### Hypotheses:
- **H1:** Players will exhibit **lower anxiety levels post-gameplay** if the game aligns with their cultural background.
- **H2:** Players from **Indian cultural backgrounds will show higher engagement** with Indian-themed games compared to non-Indian participants.
- **H3:** Cultural background and game type will significantly interact to predict **both anxiety reduction and engagement levels**.
- **H4:** Age and prior gaming experience will influence **both anxiety and engagement levels**, with younger players showing stronger effects.

## Methodology

### Study Design:
- **Experimental setup:** 2Ã—2 and 2Ã—2Ã—2 **Mixed Factorial ANOVA**
- **Conditions:**
  - **Cultural Game Condition**: Participants exposed to an **Indian culturally relevant game**.
  - **Non-Cultural Game Condition**: Participants exposed to a **game without specific cultural elements**.
- **Participants:** 27 total (23 Indian, 4 Non-Indian)
- **Data Collection Tools:** State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) & Likert Scale for Engagement

## Data Collection & Preprocessing

### Collected Data Variables:
| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Age** | Continuous | Participant's age in years |
| **Cultural Background** | Categorical | Indian / Non-Indian |
| **Game Type** | Categorical | Cultural / Non-Cultural |
| **Pre-Session Anxiety Score** | Continuous | Measured using STAI |
| **Post-Session Anxiety Score** | Continuous | Measured using STAI |
| **Engagement Score** | Continuous | Measured using a 5-point Likert scale |

### Preprocessing Steps:
âœ… **Missing Data Handling**: Mean imputation for missing values.  
âœ… **Outlier Detection**: Boxplots used to detect extreme values in anxiety scores.  
âœ… **Standardization**: Likert-scale engagement scores normalized for analysis.  
âœ… **Data Validation**: Ensured values were within the STAI and Likert scale ranges.

## Statistical Analysis

### 1. 2Ã—2 Mixed ANOVA â€“ Anxiety Reduction
- **Factors**: Time (Pre vs. Post) Ã— Game Type (Cultural vs. Non-Cultural)
- **Significant Interaction Effect**:  
  - **F(1, 25) = 5.266, p = .030, partial Î·Â² = .174**
  - **Conclusion**: Cultural games significantly reduced anxiety levels.

### 2. 2Ã—2Ã—2 Mixed ANOVA â€“ Cultural Background Effects
- **Factors**: Time Ã— Game Type Ã— Cultural Background
- **Key Findings:**  
  - **Main Effect of Cultural Background**: **F(1, 23) = 18.902, p < .001, partial Î·Â² = .451**  
  - **Main Effect of Game Type**: **F(1, 23) = 10.577, p = .004, partial Î·Â² = .315**  
  - **Interaction Effect**: Cultural background influences anxiety reduction.

### 3. Independent Samples t-Test â€“ Cultural Engagement
- **Significant difference**: **t(25) = 3.301, p = .003, d = 1.788**
- **Conclusion**: Indian participants had **higher engagement** with culturally relevant games.

### 4. Multiple Regression â€“ Predictors of Anxiety Reduction & Engagement
- Anxiety Reduction Model: **Not significant** *(p = .179, RÂ² = .189)*, but game type was a key predictor *(Î² = .412, p = .043)*.
- Cultural Engagement Model: **Highly significant** *(p < .001, RÂ² = .540)*, cultural background and game type were strong predictors.

## Power Analysis
- Conducted using **G*Power**.
- **Effect Size (Partial Î·Â² = .174) â†’ Cohenâ€™s d = 0.92**.
- **Achieved Power = 95.07%**, ensuring confidence in the results.
